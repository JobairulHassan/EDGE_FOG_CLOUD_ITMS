# Creating a Ad-Hoc Network Using Esp32 And Esp8266
### Ad hoc networking is a type of network where individual devices (We are Using ESP32 And ESP8266) are in direct communication with one another. Without the aid of a wireless router or access point, ad hoc networks can be established between two or more wireless Nodemcu ESP8266 or ESP32 devices. The numerous ESP devices directly communicate with one another.
